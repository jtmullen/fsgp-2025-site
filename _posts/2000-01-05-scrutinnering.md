# Scrutineering


Before they can get on the track, teams and their solar cars undergo several days of scrutiny from the event's technical staff. All teams will go through the same 11 stations prior to being cleared for the track.

  <tr>
    <td><b>Safety</b></td>
    <td>The Safety Check verifies that teams have the required safety equipment for solar car racing including fire extinguishers, first aid kits, and more. </td>

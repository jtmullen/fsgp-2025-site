### Official Results

__SOV Class__

The Winner of the Single Occupant Vehicle (SOV) class is simply determined by the car that drives the most laps. Once the event starts SOV vehicles can only charge from the sun. 

__MOV Class__

The Winner of the Multi Occupant Vehicle (MOV) class is determined by a scoring formula that includes miles driven, the number of people in the car, average speed, and the total external non-solar charging during the event. The formula and variable definitions are as follows: <br>

$$ 
S = \frac{1}{E} \times D \times C \times T 
$$

- __S__: Final Score
- __D__: Person Mile Distance - the number of miles driven (3.15 miles per lap) times the average number of passengers in the vehicle 
- __E__: External Energy Usage - the vehicles battery capacity (assumed to start FSGP full) plus any external grid charging during the event in kWh
- __C__: Completion Factor - the number of miles driven less penalty miles divided by the highest number of miles driven by any team 
- __T__: Target Speed Derating - 1.0 if the vehicle averages at least <b>30 mph</b> for the duration of the event. If average speed is less than 30 mph, the team will have their score derated based on the following formula: 
$$
T = (0.6)^{(30-[Average Speed])^{0.4}} 
$$
